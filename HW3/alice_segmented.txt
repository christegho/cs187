ith ink th at willbe the best plan
its ound ed an ex cellent pl an no doubt and very nea tly ands imp ly arr ang ed the only dif fic ulty was that she had not the small est idea how toset about it and whi le she was pe er ing about an xi ous ly amo ng the trees alittles ha rp bark justo ver her head made her look up in agreath ur ry
